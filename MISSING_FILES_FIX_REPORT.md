# Missing Files Fix Report

## Overview

Fixed 29 missing file references across 18 registry items where components imported sibling files but didn't declare them in their `files` array.

## Issue

Components were importing local files using relative imports (e.g., `from "./select-popover"`), but these files were not included in the component's `files` array in the registry. This would cause installation failures when users try to add these components.

## Validation

### Detection Method

Created `check-missing-files.py` script that:

1. Parses each registry item
2. Reads each component file and extracts all relative imports (`from "./..."`)
3. Checks if the imported files exist in the component's `files` array
4. Reports any missing file references

### Results

- **Before Fix**: 29 missing file references across 18 components
- **After Fix**: ✅ 0 missing file references

## Impact

These fixes ensure that:

1. ✅ All imported sibling files are properly declared
2. ✅ Component installation via registry will include all necessary files
3. ✅ No runtime errors due to missing files
4. ✅ Registry is fully self-contained and installable

## Files Modified

- `registry.json` - Added 29 file references to 18 items

## Scripts Created

- `check-missing-files.py` - Detects missing file references
- `fix-missing-files.py` - Applies the fixes automatically

## Verification Command

```bash
python check-missing-files.py
```

Output: `✅ No missing file references found!`
